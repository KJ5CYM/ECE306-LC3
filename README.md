# ECE306-LC3
LC3 (Little Computer 3) assembly programs that I created for "Introduction to Computing" with Dr. Yale N. Patt 

## LAB 1
##### comparison.bin
a machine code program that compares two numbers, X and Y. X is stored in memory location x3100 and that Y is stored in memory location x3101. The program compares X and Y, and if X > Y, store a -1 at memory location x3102; if X = Y, store a 0 at memory location x3102; and, if X < Y, store a 1 at memory location x3102. 
##### bsr.bin
a machine code program that finds the first “1” in a bit vector from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. Assumes that a bit vector B is stored in memory location x3100. Stores the index of the first “1” in memory location x3101.
##### See LAB1_TESTS directory for more information about how the programs performed for various tests. 
### Total score for this lab: 97%
